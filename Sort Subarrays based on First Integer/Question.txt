The program must accept an array of N unique integers and an integer K as the input. The
value of N is always divisible by K. The program must split the given array into N/K subarrays
of equal size K. Then the program must sort the subarrays based on the first integer. Finally,
the program must print the revised array as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= K <= N <= 1000
1 <= Each integer value <= 10^5

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integers separated by a space.
The third line contains K.

Output Format:
The first line contains the revised N integers separated by a space.

Example Input/Output:

Input:
9
30 38 33 50 55 59 10 15 12
3

Output:
10 15 12 30 38 33 50 55 59
